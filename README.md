UniSearch is a Java-based application with a simple GUI that allows users to explore top-ranked universities for Computer Science. 
After signing in through a basic login page, users can browse a list of universities, search for schools by rank, and add or remove colleges from their personal list. 
Additionally, clicking on a university name will take users directly to the institutionâ€™s official website. 
This lightweight application was ideal for me to learn Java and GUI design, offering a practical approach to handling lists, search functionality, and interactive elements.
